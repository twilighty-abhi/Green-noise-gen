## üè° Running Locally

Since this is a single-file web application, running it locally is extremely simple:

1.  **Get the Code:**
    *   Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/twilighty-abhi/Green-noise-gen.git`
    *   OR Download the `index.html` file directly.
2.  **Open the File:** Navigate to the downloaded file/cloned directory and open the `index.html` file in your preferred modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

That's it! The application should load and be ready to use.

## üìÑ Code Structure (Single File: `index.html`)

The entire application is contained within the `index.html` file, organized as follows:

1.  **`<head>`:**
    *   Metadata (`charset`, `viewport`).
    *   Title.
    *   **`<style>` block:** Contains all the CSS rules defining the application's appearance, layout, responsiveness, and theme variables.
2.  **`<body>`:**
    *   **`<div class="container">`:** Main wrapper for the UI.
        *   `<h1>`: Application title.
        *   **`<div class="visualization">`:** Contains the `<canvas id="visualizer">` element where the JavaScript draws the animation.
        *   **`<div class="controls">`:** Contains all user interface elements:
            *   Ambiance selection buttons (`.sound-options`).
            *   Volume slider (`.volume-control`).
            *   Play/Stop buttons (`.main-buttons`).
            *   Timer preset buttons (`.timer-presets`).
            *   Timer display area (`.timer-display`).
            *   Footer text.
    *   **`<script>` block:** Contains all the JavaScript logic:
        *   Configuration constants.
        *   State variables (tracking playback, timer, audio nodes, etc.).
        *   DOM element references.
        *   Canvas setup and particle creation functions (`resizeCanvas`, `createParticles`).
        *   Web Audio API setup (`initAudio`, `createSoundNode`).
        *   Playback control functions (`playCurrentSound`, `stopPlayback`, `finalizeStop`).
        *   Visualization drawing logic (`startVisualization`, `stopVisualization`, `visualize`).
        *   Timer logic (`startTimer`, `clearTimer`, `updateTimerDisplay`).
        *   Event listener setup for all buttons, sliders, window resize, and visibility changes.
        *   Initial setup code that runs when the DOM is loaded.

## üí° Potential Improvements & Customization

This project serves as a solid foundation. Here are some ideas for extending it:

*   **More Noise Types:** Add options for White Noise, Pink Noise, or Brown Noise with appropriate filtering.
*   **Advanced Ambiences:** Allow mixing sounds (e.g., Rain + Forest).
*   **Visualization Options:** Offer different visual styles or allow customization.
*   **User Preferences:** Use `localStorage` to save the user's last selected ambiance, volume level, or timer setting.
*   **Custom Timer:** Add an input field for setting a custom timer duration.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Implement shortcuts for Play/Stop and volume control.
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Add a service worker and manifest for offline access and installability.
*   **Accessibility Enhancements:** Further review and improve ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
